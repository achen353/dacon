COL Description VAL Regarded by many as Walt Disney's masterpiece, Fantasia predicted the modern music video by offering nine animated segments that were directly inspired by compressed versions of well-known classical music without necessarily adhering to the original composers' intent. Featuring the work of the Disney studio's artists at the height of their powers, and coupled with conductor Leopold Stokowski's musical arrangements, Fantasia's fanciful interpretations include a semi-abstract rendition of Bach's,Toccata and Fugue in D Minor; water sprites, dancing mushrooms, and other creatures in Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker Suite; Mickey Mouse as the title character in Paul Dukas' The Sorcerer's Apprentice; dinosaurs roaming a primordial Earth in Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring; frolicking mythical creatures in Beethoven's The Pastoral Symphony; ballet-dancing ostriches, hippopotamuses, and alligators in Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours; and the rise and fall of the dark demon Chernobog in Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain and Schubert's 'Ave Maria.' Deems Taylor's narration (and brief words by Stokowski and Mickey) provide the only spoken words in the film.	1

COL Description VAL Harvey Pekar is file clerk at the local VA hospital. His interactions with his co-workers offer some relief from the monotony, and their discussions encompass everything from music to the decline of American culture to new flavors of jellybeans and life itself. At home, Harvey fills his days with reading, writing and listening to jazz. His apartment is filled with thousands of books and LPs, and he regularly scours Cleveland's thrift stores and garage sales for more, savoring the rare joy of a,25-cent find. It is at one of these junk sales that Harvey meets Robert Crumb, a greeting card artist and music enthusiast. When, years later, Crumb finds international success for his underground comics, the idea that comic books can be a valid art form for adults inspires Harvey to write his own brand of comic book. An admirer of naturalist writers like Theodore Dreiser, Harvey makes his 'American Splendor' a truthful, unsentimental record of his working-class life, a warts-and-all self portrait. First published in 1976, the comic earns Harvey cult fame throughout the 1980s and eventually leads him to the sardonic Joyce Barber, a partner in a Delaware comic book store who end ups being Harvey's true soul mate as they experience the bizarre byproducts of Harvey's cult celebrity stature.	1

COL Description VAL In the 3D action-comedy The Green Hornet, Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) is the son of LA's most prominent and respected media magnate and perfectly happy to maintain a directionless existence on the party scene - until his father (Tom Wilkinson) mysteriously dies, leaving Britt his vast media empire. Striking an unlikely friendship with one of his father's more industrious and inventive employees, Kato (Jay Chou), they see their chance to do something meaningful for the first time in their lives:,fight crime. To get close to the criminals, they come up with the perfect cover: they'll pose as criminals themselves. Protecting the law by breaking it, Britt becomes the vigilante The Green Hornet as he and Kato hit the streets. Using all his ingenuity and skill, Kato builds the ultimate in advanced retro weaponry, Black Beauty, an indestructible car equal parts firepower and horsepower. Rolling in a mobile fortress on wheels and striking the bad guys with Kato's clever gadgets, The Green Hornet and Kato quickly start making a name for themselves, and with the help of Britt's new secretary, Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz), they begin hunting down the man who controls LA's gritty underworld: Benjamin Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz). But Chudnofsky has plans of his own: to swat down The Green Hornet once and for all. -- (C) Sony	1
